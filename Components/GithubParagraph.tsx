            My final project will be a website built with react that shows users river information around the 6 primary river
            /creeks within 50 miles of Bozeman. Additionally our website will provide the types of flys that have been catching
            fish recently in that river. I'm excited to build it seeing as Web Development and Fishing are 2 of my current hobbies<br/><br/>
